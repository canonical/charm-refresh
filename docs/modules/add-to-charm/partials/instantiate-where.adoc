== Where to instantiate

The refresh class must be instantiated as early as possible in the charm code execution.

It must be instantiated exactly once per Juju event (once per charm code execution).

However, the refresh class must be instantiated after:

* Your CharmSpecific subclass is defined
* Anything referenced by your CharmSpecific callbacks (i.e. pre-refresh checks, `refresh_snap`) is defined
+
NOTE: Some of the CharmSpecific callbacks will be implemented in later steps.
The instantiation may need to be moved after the callbacks are implemented

For most charms, it is simplest to instantiate the refresh class in the `ops.CharmBase` `+__init__+` method.
