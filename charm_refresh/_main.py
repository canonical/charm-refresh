        number) in case the user scales up the application during the refresh.

        After a unit is refreshed, the charm code should:

        1. Check the value of this attribute. If it is `True`, continue to step #2
        2. Start the workload
        3. Check if the application and this unit are healthy
        4. If they are both healthy, set `next_unit_allowed_to_refresh = True`

        If `next_unit_allowed_to_refresh` is not set to `True` (because the value of this attribute
        [step #1] was `False`, starting the workload [step #2] failed, checking if the application
        and this unit were healthy [step #3] failed, either the application or unit was unhealthy
        in step #3, or the charm code raised an uncaught exception later in the same Juju event),
        then the charm code should retry these steps, as applicable, in future Juju events until
        `next_unit_allowed_to_refresh` is set to `True` and an uncaught exception is not raised by
        the charm code later in the same Juju event.

        Also, if step #3 fails or if either the application or this unit is unhealthy, the charm
        code should set a unit status to indicate what is unhealthy.

        If the user skips the automatic checks by running the `force-refresh-start` action, the
        value of this attribute will be `True`.
